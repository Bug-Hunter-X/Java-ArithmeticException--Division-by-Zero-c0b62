# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Java: the `ArithmeticException` thrown when dividing by zero.

The `UncommonBug.java` file contains code that attempts to divide an integer by zero, resulting in an `ArithmeticException`. The solution file, `UncommonBugSolution.java` shows how to prevent this error by checking for zero as a divisor before performing the division operation.
